### Problem

I propose to add the following problem to the MPC test set. The problem can be built and tested as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import qpsolvers

def build_problem():
    # Cost: x^T P x + q^T x
    P = ...
    q = ...
    # Inequality constraints: G x <= h
    G = ...
    h = ...
    # Equality constraints: A x == b
    A = ...
    b = ...
    # Box constraints: lb <= x <= ub
    lb = ...
    ub = ...
    return qpsolvers.Problem(P, q, G, h, A, b, lb, ub)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solver = "proxqp"  # your favorite solver here
    x = qpsolvers.solve_problem(build_problem(), solver=solver)
```

### Context

<!--
    Context around this problem: how did it arise? Why is it interesting to add
    it to the benchmark?
-->

This problem is interesting because...

### Solution

<!--
    If you know a formula for the solution of the problem, you can write it
    down here. This is not a requirement but it can help us debug solver
    outputs later on.
-->

The solution to this problem is:

```math
\begin{align*}
x^\* & = ... \\
y^\* & = ... \\
z^\* & = ... \\
z_{\mathit{box}}^\* & = ... \\
\end{align*}
```

where $x^\*$ is the primal vector, $y^\*$ the dual vector for equality constraints, $z^\*$ the dual vector for inequality constraints, and $z_{\mathit{box}}^\*$ the dual vector for box constraints.

### References

    If the problem arose in a specific context, such as an engineering problem
    or a research paper, put the relevant references here.
