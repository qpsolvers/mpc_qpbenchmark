# MPC test set for QP solvers

This repository contains quadratic programs (QPs) arising from model predictive control in robotics, in a format suitable for [qpbenchmark](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark). Here is the report produced by this benchmarking tool:

## Installation

The recommended process is to install the benchmark and all solvers in an isolated environment using ``conda``:

```console
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate qpbenchmark
```

It is also possible to install the benchmark [from PyPI](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#installation).

## Usage

Run the test set as follows:

```
qpbenchmark ./mpc_qpbenchmark.py run
```

The outcome is a standardized report comparing all available solvers against the different [benchmark metrics](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#metrics). You can check out and post your own results in the [Results forum](https://github.com/qpsolvers/mpc_qpbenchmark/discussions/categories/results).
