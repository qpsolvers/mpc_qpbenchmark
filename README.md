# MPC test set for QP solvers

This repository contains quadratic programs (QPs) arising from model predictive control in robotics, in a format suitable for [qpbenchmark](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark). Here is the report produced by this benchmarking tool:

- ðŸ“ˆ <a href="./results/mpc_qpbenchmark.md"><strong>MPC test set results</strong></a>

## Installation

The recommended process is to install the benchmark and all solvers in an isolated environment using ``conda``:

```console
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate mpc_qpbenchmark
```

It is also possible to install the benchmark [from PyPI](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#installation).

### Adding HPIPM to the conda environment

HPIPM is not packaged, but instructions to install from source are given in [hpipm](https://github.com/giaf/hpipm#python):

- Clone BLASFEO: `git clone https://github.com/giaf/blasfeo.git`
- From the BLASFEO directory, run: `make shared_library -j 4`
- Check again that you are in your conda environment, then run:

```console
cp -f ./lib/libblasfeo.so ${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/
cp -f ./include/*.h ${CONDA_PREFIX}/include/
```

- Clone HPIPM: `git clone https://github.com/giaf/hpipm.git`
- From the HPIPM directory, run: `make shared_library -j4 BLASFEO_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}`
- Check again that you are in your conda environment, then run:

```console
cp -f libhpipm.so ${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/
cp -f ./include/*.h ${CONDA_PREFIX}/include/
```

- Go to `hpipm/interfaces/python/hpipm_python` and run `pip install .`
- Try to import the package in Python:

```py
import hpipm_python.common as hpipm
```

## Usage

Run the test set as follows:

```
python ./mpc_qpbenchmark.py run
```

The outcome is a standardized report comparing all available solvers against the different [benchmark metrics](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#metrics). You can check out and post your own results in the [Results forum](https://github.com/qpsolvers/mpc_qpbenchmark/discussions/categories/results).

## Limitations

Here are some known areas of improvement for this benchmark:

- [Cold start only:](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark/issues/101) we don't evaluate warm-start performance for now.
- [CPU thermal throttling:](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark/issues/88) the benchmark currently does not check the status of CPU thermal throttling.
    - Adding this feature is a good way to [start contributing](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark/labels/good%20first%20issue) to the benchmark.

Note that this test set was spun off to benefit from the availability of [qpbenchmark](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark) and readily-available MPC QPs, but it does not fully reflect the use of QP solvers for MPC in production due, notably, to the cold-start-only limitation.
